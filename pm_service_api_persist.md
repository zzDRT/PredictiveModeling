Data scientists are continuously striving to improve their models
as part of their research and development. They may add new
features to existing models and optimize the model parameters.
When data scientists develop models in an iterative fashion,
keeping track of changes can quickly become a problem. Here we
will illustrate ways to help a data scientists by providing model
versioning and keeping the whole process well organized.

Before beginning, if you are first interested in model
development, refer to the following notebooks:

*  [Developing SparkML models with Python](https://apsportal.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/d80de77f784fed7915c14353512ef14d)

*  [Developing SparkML models with Scala](https://apsportal.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/d80de77f784fed7915c1435351309e93)

## Model persistence and version control

### Generating the access token

Generate an access token using the user and password available on
the Service Credentials tab of the IBM® Watson™ Machine Learning
service instance.

Request example:

```
curl --basic --user username:password https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v2/identity/token
```
{: codeblock}

Output example:

```
{"token":"**********"}
```
{: codeblock}

Use the following terminal command to assign your token value to
the environment variable access_token:

```
access_token="<token_value>"
```
{: codeblock}

Next, to save the pipeline and the pipeline model, you'll create
the pipeline and pipeline model metadata, create the pipeline and
pipeline model version, and upload the pipeline and pipeline
model version. See the following sections for details.

### Creating pipeline metadata

To create metadata for your pipeline, describe the basic
properties of your pipeline in a curl request as shown in the
following example:

```
curl -i \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
-d '{ 
  "name": "sample pipeline",
  "description": "sample description",
  "author": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@example.com"
  },
  "type": "sparkml-pipeline-2.0",
  "runtimeEnvironment": "spark-2.0"
}' \
https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v2/artifacts/pipelines
```
{: codeblock}

Example response:

```
 HTTP/1.1 201 Created
 X-Backside-Transport: OK OK
 Connection: Keep-Alive
 Transfer-Encoding: chunked
 Content-Type: application/json
 Date: Fri, 17 Feb 2017 10:46:16 GMT
 Location: https://ibm-watson-ml.stage1.mybluemix.net/v2/artifacts/pipelines/223b38a6-41c6-417c-91ad-51064261b6f7
 Server: nginx/1.11.5
 X-Global-Transaction-ID: 3172115887
* Connection #0 to host ibm-watson-ml.stage1.mybluemix.net left intact
{"ok":"true"}
```
{: codeblock}

### Creating pipeline version

To create a version for your pipeline, specify the
parentVersionHref for your pipeline in a curl request as shown in
the following example:

```
curl -i \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
-d '{}' \
https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v2/artifacts/pipelines/1314f74d-a2a7-46d3-8f11-89baa1d7ffea/versions
```
{: codeblock}

Example response:

```
 HTTP/1.1 201 Created
 X-Backside-Transport: OK OK
 Connection: Keep-Alive
 Transfer-Encoding: chunked
 Content-Type: application/json
 Date: Fri, 17 Feb 2017 10:47:56 GMT
 Location: https://ibm-watson-ml.stage1.mybluemix.net/v2/artifacts/pipelines/223b38a6-41c6-417c-91ad-51064261b6f7/versions/0bb830fc-bc1e-439a-b929-685d9fc7712d
 Server: nginx/1.11.5
 X-Global-Transaction-ID: 3510865585
* Connection #0 to host ibm-watson-ml.stage1.mybluemix.net left intact
{"ok":"true"}
```
{: codeblock}

### Uploading pipeline content

To upload pipeline content, your pipeline must be in binary
format. To do this, invoke the save method from the SparkML
pipeline. You can upload your binary content by providing the ID
of your pipeline and version in an end point, as shown in the
following example:

```
curl -i \
-X PUT \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
-d <path_to_your_binary_content> \
https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v2/artifacts/pipelines/1314f74d-a2a7-46d3-8f11-89baa1d7ffea/versions/a535417c-ba8f-43b5-aae5-7dd8af02f518/content
```
{: codeblock}

Example response:

```
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 X-Backside-Transport: OK OK
 Connection: Keep-Alive
 Transfer-Encoding: chunked
 Content-Type: application/json
 Date: Fri, 17 Feb 2017 10:50:53 GMT
 Server: nginx/1.11.5
 X-Global-Transaction-ID: 980490895
* Connection #0 to host ibm-watson-ml.stage1.mybluemix.net left intact
{"ok":"true"}
```
{: codeblock}

After you save the pipeline, you can continue with saving your
pipeline model.

### Creating pipeline model metadata

You must describe the data schema of your pipeline model as shown
in the following example:

```
curl -i \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
-d ' {
  "name": "sample-model",
  "description": "sample description",
  "author": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@example.com"
  },
  "pipelineVersionHref": "string",
  "type": "sparkml-model-2.0",
  "runtimeEnvironment": "spark-2.0",
  "trainingDataSchema": {
    "type": "struct",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": "double",
        "nullable": true,
        "metadata": {}
      },
      {
        "name": "review",
        "type": "string",
        "nullable": true,
        "metadata": {}
      },
      {
        "name": "label",
        "type": "int",
        "nullable": true,
        "metadata": {}
      }
    ]
  },
  "labelCol": "string",
  "inputDataSchema": {
    "type": "struct",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": "double",
        "nullable": true,
        "metadata": {}
      },
      {
        "name": "review",
        "type": "string",
        "nullable": true,
        "metadata": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}' \
https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v2/artifacts/models
```

### Creating pipeline model version

To create a version for your pipeline model, use a curl request
to specify details such as the location you store your training
data and the model evaluation method. See the following example:

```
curl -i \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
-d ' {
  "trainingDataRef": {
    "connection": {

### Uploading pipeline model content

To upload pipeline model content, your pipeline model must be in
binary format. To do this, invoke the save method from the
SparkML pipeline model. You can upload your binary content by
providing the ID of your pipeline and version in an end point, as
shown in the following example:

```
curl -i \
-X PUT \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
-d <path_to_your_binary_content> \
